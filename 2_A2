Write a python program to store marks stored in subject "Fundamentals of Data Structure" by
 N students in the class. Write functions to compute following:
        1. The average score of the class.
        2. Highest score and lowest score of the class.
        3. Count of students who were absent for the test.
        4. Display mark with highest frequency.
