Write a python program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from 
console input . the transaction log format is shown as following : D 100 W 200 
(Withdrawal is not allowed if balance is going negative . Write function for withdraw and deposite)
D means deposite while W means withdrawal .
suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
    D 300 , D 300 , W 200 , D 100 Then, the output should be : 500
'''

def deposit(amount):
    global balance
    balance = balance + amount

def withdrawal(amount):
    global balance
    if (balance >= amount):
        balance = balance - amount
        print("transaction is successful")
    else:
        print("withdrawal is not allowed")

list = []
balance = 0

while True:
    data = input("please enter the transaction details:\n")
    if data == 'Exit' or data == 'exit':
        break
    list.append(data.split())  
print(list)

for i in list:
    if (i[0] == 'D'):
        deposit(int(i[1]))
    elif (i[0] == 'W'):
        withdrawal(int(i[1]))

print("balance is:", balance)
